# 🏦 The Denome

**The Denome** is a lightweight web-based tool that helps **bank tellers** manage cash quickly and accurately.  
It supports two main workflows:

1. **Cash Counting** – Enter the number of notes for each denomination, and the system instantly calculates the total sum.  
2. **Cash Dispensing** – Input a withdrawal amount, and the system suggests how many **200, 100, 50, 10, 5, and 1 birr notes** to give to the customer.
